s:811:"<p>The chat module contains some features to make chatting a little nicer.</p>

<ul><li>Smilies - Any smiley faces (emoticons) that you can type elsewhere in Moodle can also be typed here, for example :-)</li>
<li>Links - Website addresses will be turned into links automatically</li>
<li>Emoting - You can start a line with "/me" or ":" to emote, for example if your name is Kim and you type ":laughs!" or "/me laughs!" then everyone will see "Kim laughs!"</li>
<li>Beeps - You can send a sound to other participants by clicking the "beep" link next to their name. A useful shortcut to beep all the people in the chat at once is to type "beep all".</li>
<li>HTML - If you know some HTML code, you can use it in your text to do things like insert images, play sounds or create different coloured text</li>
</ul>";
